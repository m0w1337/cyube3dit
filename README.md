2. Unpack the .zip package to any folder with write permission.
3. Navigate into the "bin" folder and start the executable.
4. Please don't be afraid when seeing the yellow microsoft defender warning, this only appears, because smart people believe, that developers should pay a minimum of 100$ per year for a certificate, just so their software will be considered "safe". Unless you want to pay for this tool in the future, I suggest to simply ignore this warning.
5. For further information please stay tuned, as this page is currently being filled with content ;) (or help me fill it)
